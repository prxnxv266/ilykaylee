        <p class="text-xl text-center text-white">
        So, I made this website just for you, keeping in mind all the things I know you love. To start, you may have already noticed, but if not, then this websites background color is made up of your two fav colors: Pink💖 and Purple💜!!
        </p>
        <p class="text-xl text-center text-white">
<br>
        Theres so much that i want to tell you, but first, lets hear a song from your fav artist, Jhené Aiko. I've dedicated this song to you and our relationship darling and the song is "While We're Young". This song means a lot to me and our relationship. This actually was the top played song in my spotify wrapped! Which is crazy because I only came to know of Jhené Aiko from you, and the fact that i started listening to her because of you and it became my top song for the year is crazy. But anyways, if you want you can hear the song while scrolling down the website <br><br>

        Okay, lets move on. <br>
</p>
<p class="text-xl text-center text-white mt-4">   
	So, I have always liked poetry and I love writing poems. I did'nt really get the time or the moment in the past to write it for someone, but I wrote one for you 2 months back, which I showed to you and you liked it. So, I made another one. These poems truly express my heart and my feelings for you, and they personally mean a lot to me. <br>	My love, every word of these poems is a piece of my heart, written with you in mind. 
            You inspire me to express feelings I've never known, and I hope these words reflect the depth of my love for you. <br><br>

kaylee, I know you love soccer (yes, I called it soccer because of you hehe) and I'm actually so lucky that you play soccer at a pro level, and I'm sooo happy that you do, I'm the luckiest guy in every way because I have you baby. Speaking of soccer, I have outlined three important milestones in our relationship. Check it out!

I know youre the best at whatever you do, and I'm pretty sure my pretty baby is the best at soccer and I'm always behind you no matter you win or lose, but no matter the result, I know my baby tries her best and thats what matters and I'm proud of you for that kaylee. I actually want to see you in a Manchester City kit and thats my dream, I can only wish. But, when you do come to the UK, I have made some amazing plans for you and one of those plans is take you to the Etihad Stadium (Man City's Home Stadium) for a stadium tour and then buy you a jersey with your name on it and then we both click a picture with it!!! I can only dream about it, but hopefully it happens i would be happi happi hehe

kaylee, you're my favourite person ever and you're the best thing that has ever happened to me. And for my special person, I actually made a song playlist, it's all about you, for you, for us. I showed this playlist to you a couple months back, but it wasnt complete then and I was just building it up for this moment. Each and every song in this playlist reminds me of you, and our relationship, how amazing it has been for me to be with you. I would love it if you saved it and have a listen to it whenever you're free, I would really appreciate it. <br><br>

This playlist has a total of 65 songs, and 4 hrs worth of playtime. 4 because we've been together for 4 months!!!💚. And these past 4 months have been the most beautiful of my life. So, happy 4 months sweetheart!!! I love you. Also, this playlist starts with the song named ily and from the 2nd song onwards until the 7th song, if you take the first letter out of each song, it says kaylee, so "ily kaylee" is what the whole thing means. You can see what i mean by having a look at the images below. <br><br>

<p class="text-xl text-center text-white mt-4"> <br>So, i thought that I should give you something for christmas, but you just didn't accept anything from me, you wouldn't even take money from me and buy whatever you wanted. But anyways, this was one of the main reasons I wanted to make this website for you, to show you my love and affection. Also, I wanted to make something for you, that would exist forever, even when I'll be gone or if we split up, this website will always be here for you, and even 5 or 10 years from now, no matter what happens, you can visit it to relive these memories.</p>

      kaylee, everyone has someone special in their life, and for me it's you. I remember the first time we started texting. You were the reason I got my smile back, the reason I fell asleep with a smile on my face, the reason I had motivation to do things again. kaylee, you truly have made my life better by just being in it. You are my reason to smile everyday. baby, you're worth appreciating, you're worth risking it all for, you're worth loving, you're worth everything<br> <br>
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-center text-white mt-4">
      I wanted to let you know that I'm proud of you for everything, you were and are still dealing with a lot of stuff, and I pray that it gets better for you no matter what it is, and I'm always available for you. A pure and kind hearted soul like you don't deserve to go through the pain and deserves all the love in this world. Please never be afraid to talk about your problems, you wont overshare or annoy me, I will always listen to you. <br><br>I hope you enjoy each and every moment of us, just like I'm enjoying, because we both know, if it doesn't work out in the future, we will miss this, the way we used to talk, joke, annoy each other, me yapping to you about some random things, and most importantly, me caring for you.

<p class="text-xl text-center text-white mt-4">If we ever split up, i want you to<br>
-take care of yourself <br>

kaylee, i want you to know that<br>
-even when you're feeling down, I'll always choose you<br>
-even when you're not at your best, I'll always choose you<br>

-I'll choose you every single time, always remember that <br><br>
I want to see you win, see you smash every dream you have, I want you to overcome all the barriers you face, and see you succeed in life. You know I'm your biggest fan and I'll be with you every single step of the way, with or without me I want to see you achieve everything you desire. <br><br>
I promise you that no matter what happens, I'll always be there for you, distance won't matter between us. If your heart is speaking, then I'm listening. If your heart is bleeding, then I'm here to heal it. <br>
   <br>I wanted to say thank you for being you and thank you for everything that you've done for me. You are the best girlfriend and the best friend in this world. You also are an amazing daughter to your parents, and I'm sure they're very proud of you. Just as a person, you are truly special, never forget that and just keep being you. I hope I can see this happy, playful, joyful, and cheerful version of Kaylee forever. I'll always be rooting for you 🤍 <br><br>
Finally, my graduation ceremony is in March 2025, and I've decided that I'm gonna make a speech about all the important people in my life. And, you are the most important person in my life and I'm gonna include you as my special person. I'll stand in front of people to deliver the speech and I'll thank you for being such a beautiful part of my journey.<br>
